# Earthquake Shakes Twitter Users: Event Detection by Social Sensors [Web Information Retrieval]

Authors: Matteo Mariani & Riccardo Chiaretti.

Earthquake event detection through tweet analysis using:
- Tweepy
- CrisisNLP Dataset
- OOV
- Word2vec trained on CrisisNLP Dataset
- Event Detection library

This is a project for Web Information Retrieval course of Master's degree, Engineering in Computer Science.

Microblogging platforms such as Twitter provide active communication channels during crisis or calamity events such as earthquakes, typhoons or conflicts. During these events, affected people post useful information on Twitter that can be used for situational awareness and other humanitarian disaster responses, if processed timely and effectively.

Inspired by Takeshi Sakaki, Makoto Okazaki, and Yutaka Mat's work, we designed a tweet-based earthquake detection system applying some modifications and simplification.
